# Exercise: Events

## Description:

Build a simple "Form" application using React events. You'll need to create one component to complete this exercise:

- **Form**: This component will render a input and a button.

## Here are the steps to complete this exercise:

1. Create a new React component called Form that has a text input and a button.
2. In the Form component, set the initial state of the input to an empty string.
3. Add an onChange event listener to the input field that updates the component's state with the value entered by the user.
4. Add an onClick event listener to the button that logs the current value of the input field to the console.
